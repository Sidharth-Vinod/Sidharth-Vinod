## 🚀 About Me

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineer who enjoys turning ideas into real-world tech. Whether it's building antennas in HFSS or wiring up Arduino sensors, I'm all about solving problems with code, circuits, and coffee.

I specialize in **RF circuits**, **IoT systems**, and **PCB design**, with a soft spot for simulation tools that crash 5 minutes before the deadline. 🫠

When I'm not debugging (read: crying over) microwave components, I’m probably experimenting with something new or exploring how tech can impact the environment and healthcare.

## ⚒️ What I Play With

- **Hardware & Sim Tools:** HFSS, CST, LTSpice, AWR, Ansoft Designer, KiCad  
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Matlab (and fluent in debug-ese)  
- **Buzzwords I Like:** RF & Microwave, Antennas, IoT, PCB Design, Environmental Sensing

## 🧠 Cool Stuff I’ve Built

| Project                                     | What It Does                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🌱 Air Quality + Color Detection System** | Arduino-based environmental monitor using MQ-135 + TCS3200. Reads the air *and* judges your outfit. |
| **📡 Microstrip Patch Antenna @2.4GHz**     | Designed and simulated in HFSS. Return loss so low, it came back emotionally stable.                |
| **🛰️ Microwave Component Suite**            | Built & tested filters, power dividers, couplers. Basically LEGO, but for EM waves.                 |
| **🧲 IR Sensor PCB Design (KiCad)**          | Custom schematic and PCB layout for object detection — clean signals, clean layout.                 |

## 🔭 What's Next?

- 🤖 Dive deeper into embedded AI and wireless sensor networks  
- 🌍 Build more open-source projects  
- 🔄 Maybe break fewer things while soldering
